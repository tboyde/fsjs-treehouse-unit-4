# FSJS-Treehouse-Unit 4: Phrase Hunter Game

This project is a browser-based, word guessing game that allows users to find encouraging phrases. Once a user starts the game, a phrase is randomly selected and the user must use the on-screen keyboard to enter letter that they believe will be included within the phrase. Each user has five lives and for each letter entered incorrectly, the user will lose one life.

So, give it a try and feel free to let me know what you think of this game.
